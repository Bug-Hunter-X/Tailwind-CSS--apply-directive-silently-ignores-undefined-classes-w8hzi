This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist.  For example:

```html
<div class="@apply non-existent-class"></div>
```

Tailwind CSS will not throw an error, but the `non-existent-class` will simply be ignored, leading to unexpected styling issues.  Debugging this can be tricky because there's no obvious error message.
